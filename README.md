# EMNIST_Many_Ways

### Intro
EMNIST/MNIST (honestly, particularly MNIST) are both well known and popular datasets within the world of ML/data science for good reason. They provide a great trove of clean, reliable data to explore, test and show-off techniques with. Going along with that long tradition, I wanted to show off some of my own explorations over time with EMNIST, and some of the things that can be done. In the Notebooks folder you'll find 3 Jupyter notebooks covering the following:
1. EMNIST_Classification:
	* Unsupervised learning techniques for feature reduction and dimensionality reduction to drive standard (non-NN) classification techniques
2. EMNIST_CNN
	* Neural Networks and Convolutional Neural Networks for classification
3. EMNIST_Generator_Images:
	* Load a (admittedly undertrained) generator model trained in a GAN architecture to produce 'handwritten' text
